# Pixel Art - South Park Characters Swap

This repository contains an activity requested by Professor [Fred](https://github.com/fbamuniz) in the Web Programming discipline, in the year 2023, at Etec de Registro, in the System Development course.

In this activity, a simple HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code was developed to create a pixel art using arrays. The pixel art consists of two images of the characters Eric Cartman and Kyle from the series South Park. When the mouse is hovered over the image of Eric Cartman, it is replaced by the image of the character Kyle.

## How It Works

- Open the `index.html` file in a web browser.
- Hover over the image of Eric Cartman to see the character swap.
